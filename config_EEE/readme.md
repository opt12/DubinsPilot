# Configuration File
Copy the cnfiguration file `PID_Parameters.conf` to your ~/.config/ directory in a subfolder named `EEE`.

`~/.config/EEE/PID_Parameters.conf`

This configuration file contains suitable parameters for the stock Cessna 172 airplane contained in X-Plane. For different aircraft, different parameter sets need to be figured out.

**_Please be aware, that sometimes, parameters break with X-Plane updates without further notice. So be careful when updating X-Plane and if in doubt, backup your entire X-Plane folder before. Or, even easier most of the time, adapt the parameters afterwards**_

## Attention
Check the key for the path to the logfile-folder:

`initialLogFileDir=../FlightTestLogfiles`

If this does not suit your neede, adapt it.
